# Hello, World

I'm attempting to give back to the community with a series of guides to help through potentially sticky processes. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions!

## About this page

I've seen a lot of community utilizing various KB systems as of recent, which is awesome! I haven't seen MkDocs used much, if at all, so I figure knocking out two birds with one stone will be the move here. If interested in configuring this yourself, let me know - or, if this seems clunky, let me know even louder.
