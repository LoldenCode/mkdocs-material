# âœ… CIPP installation (As of April 30, 2024)

## Prerequisites

* A GitHub account
* A Microsoft 365 tenant
* 30 minutes, roughly

## Getting Started

1. Ensuring that you're logged into GitHub, navigate to the two following pages and fork both to repositories that retain the original name.

* [https://github.com/KelvinTegelaar/CIPP](https://github.com/KelvinTegelaar/CIPP)
* [https://github.com/KelvinTegelaar/CIPP-API](https://github.com/KelvinTegelaar/CIPP-API)

!!! info ""
  To Fork a GitHub repo, in the top right, click on the **Fork** button

2. Again, ensure that the **Repository name** field matches the originals (CIPP and CIPP-API, respectively). Keep the box for `Copy the master branch only` checked, then click `Create Fork`
3. Create a Token in GitHub. This will allow you to link the repo to your Azure, and allow the automation to work seamlessly :tm:
   1. Click on your user icon in the top right.
   2. Navigate to **Settings**
   3. Navigate to **Developer Settings**
   4. Expand **Personal Access Tokens** then choose **Tokens (classic)**
   5. Click **Generate new token > Generate new token (classic)**
   6. Name your new token something memorable, then check the permissions for **repo**, **workflow**, and **write:packages**. You should have a result similar to this (note that repo has unchecked itself, because...programming or something):\
      ![](<.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>)
   7. If all looks good, click on **Generate token** at the bottom of the page. Document the token value in a secure location.

## Deploy the Static Web App

1. Ensuring you're logged into a Microsoft 365 account with access to both an active **Azure Subscription** and an **Azure Resource Group,** proceed to the following link:\
   [https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FKelvinTegelaar%2FCIPP%2Fdev%2Fdeployment%2FAzureDeploymentTemplate.json](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FKelvinTegelaar%2FCIPP%2Fdev%2Fdeployment%2FAzureDeploymentTemplate.json)
2. Select your Subscription and Resource Group.&#x20;
   1. While not necessary, I prefer to have a separate Resource Group for CIPP.
3. Select the nearest region that supports **Static Web Apps** (SWA's). As of time of writing, these are the supported options:\
   \* Central US\
   \* East US 2\
   \* East Asia\
   \* West Europe\
   \* West US 2
4. Update the Github Repository, GitHub Token, and GitHub API Repository with details that reflect your environment. You should end up with a page looking similar to this:\
   ![](<.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)
5. Click **Review + create** at the bottom. Confirm all looks good on the Review page, click Okay.
6. You should be at your deployment page now:\
   ![](<.gitbook/assets/image (6).png>)\
   At this point, wait until the blue bar beneath the bell in the top right finishes doing nerdy stuff. Grab yourself a tea or something, the hard part is over.
7. Once back from your tea break, you should be shown a screen as follows:\
   ![](.gitbook/assets/image.png)
8. Click on the **Resource Group,** then navigate to your **Static Web App**\
   \
   ![](<.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)
9. Under **Settings** on the left pane, navigate to **Role management**.
10. Select **Invite User**, then input your user's Email Address, and input `admin` as the role. Generate the invitation link, and head on in. **Grant Consent** when requested, and you should be redirected to your new CIPP instance.

## Post Install configuration

1. Repeat the invitation process for any other technicians that you are inviting for your testing phase of CIPP, or other IT team members if deploying for an internal organization.
2. From your Azure page, navigate back to the main Resource Group, and click into your **Function app**.
3. Navigate to **Functions > Settings > Configuration**.
4. Add a **New application setting** at the top of this page, named `WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE` with a value of `1`. Click ok, then Save at the top of the prior page.
5. Navigate to **Functions > Deployment > Deployment Center**
6. Under the source **External git**, click **Disconnect then confirm.**
7. The page should refresh, with a required field for **Source.** Choose Github, then click **Authorize**.
8. Select the Organization, Repo, and Branch that reflect your Fork of **CIPP-API.** Scroll down, ensuring that **Add a workflow** and **Basic authentication** are checked. Finally, click **Save** at the top.
9. Navigate to the main Overview page of the function app, then click on **Restart** in the top pane to f finalize the changes.
10. Follow the steps [https://docs.cipp.app/setup/installation/samwizard](https://docs.cipp.app/setup/installation/samwizard) to create the SAM for your clients, or wait for me to write the rest of this.
11. After building your SAM, and having your GDAP relationships set up, navigate to **SETTINGS > CIPP > Application Settings > Tenants**
12. Check the pickbox to select all clients, then choose the option to perform a CPV refresh. This will consent them to your SAM application.
13. Enjoy!

## Automatic Updates

1. Browse to [https://github.com/apps/pull](https://github.com/apps/pull) and click "install".
2. Choose the organization (if applicable), then **Only select repositories**, and choose both your CIPP and CIPP-API. Click **Install**
3. Navigate to your **CIPP** repository on GitHub, then browse to the folder `.Github\Workflows`. Locate the file named `AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN_<WORD>_<WORD>_<UUID>.yml`
4. Open this file, then click the Edit icon in the rop right. Around the 7th line, there will be a code block like such:

```yml
pull_request:
  types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, closed]
  branches:
    - main
```

5. Remove these lines, then click **Commit changes...** in the top right. Leave everything in the popup window as it is, with the radio button on **Commit directly to the \`main\` branch** selected. Click on **Commit changes.**
6. Wait for the next release of CIPP (Typically every other Friday, but there are some dev sprints that run a little longer). CIPP will warn you of an update, so log back into your GitHub and go to your CIPP repo.
7. Click on **Sync fork**, then **Update Branch**
   1. NOTE: DO NOT CHOOSE THE "Do you want to Discard # Commits"
8. On your GitHub page, you will have a new Pull Request. Click on the "Run Workflow" button, then "Merge". Moving forward, your repo will automatically update

### Todo

* Document the next two possible pathways:
  * Setting up the SAM service account
  * Configuring CIPP to function on your own tenant
* Grab screenshots of the autoupdate configuration.

!!! danger "Warning"
  Please be smart and set up a separate CIPP tenant if you intend to manage your parent tenant.
